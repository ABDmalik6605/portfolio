# Images Folder

This folder contains images for your portfolio.

## Profile Picture

Place your profile picture here as:
- `profile.jpg` or
- `profile.png`

Recommended size: 500x500 pixels (square)

## Project Images

You can also add project screenshots here:
- `project1.jpg`
- `project2.jpg`
- etc.

Then reference them in your projects like:
```tsx
image: '/images/project1.jpg'
```

## Tips

- Keep file sizes under 500KB for fast loading
- Use descriptive names
- Use JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- Next.js will automatically optimize images at build time
